# Booking

You are in charge of building a new system to handle concerts and events tickets.
You already know that your system will be used by both small business (maybe a school organizing an event) or by international star for a "tour".

Your SaaS system should be able to handle that workload and be optimized as best as you can.

## Requirement

Docker

## Microservices

- **Users** : This microservice is used to manage users, such as registering and creating accounts, updating, and deleting.
- **Events** : This microservice is used to manage events.
- **Auth** : This microservice is used for user authentication, such as login.
- **Tickets** : This microservice is used to manage tickets, allowing users to buy single or multiple tickets.
- **Notification** : This microservice is used for sending email notifications.
